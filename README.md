# ScavengerHunt

A web and android app that helps host large scale scavenger hunt games. Set up and track user progress on the web app, and participate in the scavenger hunt, track progress and location using the android app. There are currently two other repositories holding the Heroku deployed ScavengerHunt server, and the Android app. The purpose of this repo is to have the two components in one spot.

## Android

To run the android app, open project using Android Studio and export as APK.

## Server

To run the server, enter the command in the Profile in your terminal.

## Web

Currently we are using cross-domain accessing for development. To run the react web app, enter the server folder -> app -> creater, and use the command "yarn start"
